# C HTTP Client

C HTTP Client is a lightweight HTTP client implemented in C, designed to interact with web servers and RESTful APIs. It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, including handling JSON and URL-encoded payloads. This project demonstrates low-level socket programming, HTTP protocol handling, and basic API communication.

## Features

- Send `HTTP` `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests.
- Support for `JSON` and `URL-encoded` payloads.
- Command-line interface for interacting with `APIs`.
- Error handling for invalid requests and responses.

## Technologies Used

- `C` programming language
- `POSIX` sockets for network communication
- Standard libraries for `string parsing` and `memory management`
- `Makefile` for build automation

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates practical skills in:

- `Socket` programming and network communication in C.
- Understanding the `HTTP protocol`.
- Parsing and constructing `HTTP requests and responses`.
- Working with `JSON` and `URL-encoded` data in C.
